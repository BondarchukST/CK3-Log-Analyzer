‚öîÔ∏è CK3 Log Analyzer

Program

This program analyzes error.log and sorts errors by mod directory.

üîπ Features:

‚úÖ Automatically sorts found errors into files and directories.
‚úÖ Option to use a text editor to open error lines.
‚úÖ Built-in function to check mod compatibility.
‚úÖ English and Russian language

To run, use the main executable file - ck3_log_parser.py

I created it.exe using auto-py-to-exe, adding other files to (Additional Files) during creation


While simple, it's a useful utility. It makes navigating errors slightly easier, though not all. The parser still doesn't understand error context‚Äîyou'll need to open the error line in error.log yourself and look nearby to find the context.

Some mods, especially older ones, use outdated pointers, triggers, or functions. This tool may slightly ease your search for bugs and fixes.

Regarding mod compatibility: no fancy tricks here. The parser checks which mods you have and which ones use the same files. It detects `00_holding` wherever possible. If the "other mods" list is too long, double-click it to open a separate window listing conflicting mods. This helps you decide whether to disable them or adjust their load order.

There was an idea to make a real-time parser with directory sorting, but my hardware nearly died from the load, and it worked poorly. So, static analysis only. Launch the game, wait until the main menu loads, then start scanning. It's preliminary‚Äîmore errors will accumulate during gameplay.

That's about it. Might be useful to someone.
